# Air Taranis

## Setup

The SDK can be downloaded and the inferface recompiled for python3 using the `all` recipe:

```bash
make all
```


Then, simply source the environment using the setenv script at the root of the project:

```bash
source ./setenv
```

Now you should be able to use the Leap sdk.
```python
import Leap
```
